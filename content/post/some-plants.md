I've been bitten by the gardening bug, and have been dabbling in hydroponic gardening. Regular dirt (read: peasant) gardening as well, but mostly hydro.
Decided to try my hand at taking artsy pictures of my little babies...I may to a tour of the current hydroponic system as well. Definitely plan to do a
build-along article for the next setup I build.
